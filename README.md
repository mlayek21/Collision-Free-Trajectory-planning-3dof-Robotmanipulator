# Collision-Free Trajectory Planning for 3R Robot Manipulator

This project was completed as part of the ME850A course at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kanpur, under the supervision of Dr Aninda Chatterjee.

- Collision-free trajectory planning for a 3DOF (degree of freedom) manipulator refers to the process of finding a path for the manipulator to follow that does not result in collisions with any obstacles or other objects in the environment. This is an important consideration in robotic applications, as collisions can cause damage to the manipulator and its surroundings, and can also disrupt the accuracy and precision of the manipulator's movements.

- To plan a collision-free trajectory for a 3DOF manipulator, we need to consider the constraints and limitations of the manipulator, as well as the layout and characteristics of the environment in which it will be operating. This may involve modeling the manipulator and its environment, and using algorithms to search for a path that satisfies the required constraints and avoids collisions.

- Collision avoidance is a related concept that refers to the ability of a manipulator to detect and avoid collisions in real-time, while it is in motion. This can be achieved through the use of sensors, such as lasers or cameras, that can detect the presence and location of obstacles in the environment. The manipulator can then use this information to adjust its trajectory or speed in order to avoid a collision.

- Both collision-free trajectory planning and collision avoidance are important considerations in the design and operation of robotic manipulators, as they help to ensure the safety and reliability of the manipulator, and can also improve its performance and efficiency.

## Objective
-The objective of a project or task is the overall goal or purpose that it is intended to achieve. It is a statement of what is to be accomplished and why it is important. The objective should be clear, specific, and measurable, and it should provide a basis for evaluating the success or effectiveness of the project.

- In the context of the project described in the previous answer, the objective was to design and implement a collision-free trajectory planning algorithm for a 3R robot manipulator. This means that the goal of the project was to create a method for finding a path for the manipulator to follow that avoids collisions with obstacles in the environment. The objective of this project was likely motivated by the importance of ensuring the safety and reliability of the manipulator, and by the need for efficient and accurate navigation in order to achieve the manipulator's desired goals.

## Procedure
The procedure of a project or task refers to the steps or actions that are taken in order to complete it. It outlines the sequence of events that need to happen in order to achieve the project's objectives, and it provides a plan for how the work should be carried out. A procedure should be clear, concise, and easy to follow, and it should include any necessary instructions, guidelines, or requirements.

In the context of the project described in the previous answer, the procedure for designing and implementing a collision-free trajectory planning algorithm for a 3R robot manipulator might include the following steps:

- Define the problem: Clearly identify the goal of the project and the constraints and limitations that need to be considered.
- Research and analysis: Conduct research to gather information about the manipulator, the environment in which it will operate, and the methods and techniques that can be used to plan a collision-free trajectory.
- Design: Develop a plan or approach for generating a collision-free path for the manipulator. This may involve developing a mathematical model or algorithm, or adapting an existing method.
- Implementation: Code or build the algorithm or method in a suitable programming language or software environment.
- Testing: Evaluate the performance of the algorithm or method in simulation or real-world conditions, and make any necessary adjustments or improvements.
- Deployment: Implement the algorithm or method in the manipulator's control system, and test it in real-world conditions to ensure that it is working correctly and efficiently.
